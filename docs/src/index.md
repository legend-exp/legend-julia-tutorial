# LEGEND Julia Software Stack Tutorial

This tutorial demonstrates the LEGEND Julia software stack: It shows how to simulate an inverted-coaxial HPGe detector, how to generate detector waveforms based on Geant4 MC results, how to reconstruct an energy spectrum from the simulated pulses and how to perform an auto-calibration of the resulting spectrum.
